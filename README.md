The overall idea of Word-Count is to create a binary search tree data structure (without using the one already implemented in java), then use this tree to read a text input file to find statistics of certain words.  The output of this program is an alphabetically ordered list of words read from the file with their frequencies, (number of occurrences in the text,) with the total number of words read in the text, the total number of unique words, the height of the tree, and the average depth of a node.  If the phrase "this code is good code" was passed through the program, the output would list these 5 words in alphabetical order with "code" having a frequency of 2 (and the rest of the words have 1) and there would be 4 total unique words.
